## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] Navigate to the `index.html` file. 
2. [ ] In line 1, type an exclamation point, wait to see the prompt, then hit `enter`.
3. [ ] Inside the body tag, put the appropriate header tag for a main header with the copy: 
   `Hello World!`
4. [ ] Under that, put a paragraph tag under that and copy and paste:
    `World, this is my first time coding!`
5. [ ] Write another paragraph tag under the previous and copy and pastethis copy:
   `I'm ready to learn a lot!`

🎊 **Fantastic work! You just finished your first ever HTML coding demo.** 🎊
